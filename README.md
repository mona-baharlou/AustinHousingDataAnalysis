# Austin Housing Data Analysis with PowerBI
I'm currently working on this project

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of real estate properties and school data in Austin, Texas. It combines key metrics related to home prices, property characteristics, and school ratings to offer insights for potential buyers, investors, or researchers.


- The dashboard reveals significant disparities in property prices and sizes, with luxury properties concentrated near scenic areas like the Colorado River.
- School ratings and sizes vary across zip codes, which may influence buyer decisions for families.
- The inclusion of geographic data (latitude/longitude) allows for spatial analysis of trends.
